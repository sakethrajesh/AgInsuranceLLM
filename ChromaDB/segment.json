Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that 'No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.' Therefore, programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance must operate in a non-discriminatory manner. Also, a recipient of RMA funding may not retaliate against any person because they opposed an unlawful practice or policy or made charges, testified, or participated in a complaint under Title VI. It is the AIPs' responsibility to ensure that standards, procedures, methods, and instructions as authorized by FCIC in the sale and service of crop insurance contracts are implemented in a manner compliant with Title VI.

The percent of value allows insureds with more than one unit to individualize their coverage within the requirements of the program. Using the percent of value insureds can allocate a percentage of the total insured value to each selected index interval. Example: Insured A has a 100 percent share in 1000 insurable acres in the grid and elects to insure all 1000 acres with an intended use of grazing. The county base value is $20.00 per acre. Insured A selects a 90 percent coverage level, 120 percent productivity factor, and the April – May and July – August index intervals. The dollar amount of protection per acre is $21.60 ($20.00 × .90 × 1.20) and the total policy protection is $21600 ($21.60 × 1000 acres). Insured A allocates 60 percent of the total value to the April – May index interval and 40 percent to the July – August index interval. Based on Insured A’s allocation, the policy protection amount for the unit comprised of the April – May index interval is $12960 ($21.60 × 1000 acres × 60 percent of value × 1.00 share). The policy protection amount for the unit comprised of the July – August index interval is $8640 ($21.60 × 1000 acres × 40 percent of value × 1.00 share). The total policy protection amount ($21600) does not change. Regardless of how the total value is allocated between index intervals, the sum of the percentages for all index intervals, by grid ID, share, irrigated practice, organic practice (if applicable), and intended use, must equal 100 percent.There may be a minimum and maximum percent of value that can be allocated to an index interval.

Selection of index intervals is critical to the effectiveness of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance as a risk management tool. Factors to be considered when determining which index intervals to select include, but are not limited to, type of forage or plant to be pollinated, location, elevation, intended use, and the time period when precipitation is needed under normal conditions for the insured crop. Selecting index intervals when precipitation is not needed for the insured crop or when precipitation does not normally occur is not an effective use of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance nor is insuring periods when livestock or colonies will be on the property unless that corresponds to when precipitation is critical. Example: Based on the location of the land, type of grass, and intended use, precipitation is needed in the months of March, April, May, and June for the grass to produce a normal amount of forage under normal conditions during the normal growing season. Selecting index intervals before March or after June would not be an effective use of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance because precipitation received during those index intervals is not as needed for the normal growing season.",

    "document": "Identifying Acreage Locating an Insured’s Acreage The Grid Locator map and tools provide multiple options for identifying the insured’s acreage to establish a point of reference and determine the grid ID. The following steps provide one method for locating the insured’s acreage. (1) In the “Find address or place” search box located at the top of the Grid Locator page, enter the city and state near the acreage to be insured, or the county and state in which the acreage to be insured is physically located, then click the “Search” button. (2) Navigate close to where the acreage to be insured is physically located. Use of the zoom function and alternative map views may help identify roads, ponds, buildings, rivers, or other landmarks or features that will help navigate to the applicable acreage. (3) Use the zoom function and move the map to display the acreage to be insured in enough detail that a point of reference can be established within the field boundaries. The following is an example of the Grid Locator page for PRF when “McLouth, Kansas” is searched by using the search box. [This image shows a map of the Grid Locator page for PRF with a focus on McLouth, Kansas. The map displays various grid squares over a standard road map with city names, roads, and geographical boundaries highlighted.] The following is an example of the Grid Locator page for PRF using the imagery map view to navigate to acreage located a few miles from McLouth, Kansas, using roads and other landmarks to locate the acreage.

Acreage separated by only a public or private right-of-way, waterway, or an irrigation canal will be considered contiguous. (2) for apiculture, acreage which contains locations owned or controlled by the insured or rented by the insured for cash or crop share, in a county or grid that continues into an adjoining county or grid without interruption and is occupied and foraged by insurable colonies. Acreage separated by only a public or private right-of-way, waterway, or an irrigation canal will be considered contiguous. Expected grid index: A grid index determined by FCIC based on the mean accumulated precipitation by index interval, calculated by using NOAA’s interpolated historical gridded precipitation data, or successor data, based on a 24-hour period determined by the data, normalized and expressed as a percentage such that the mean is 100. The data used to calculate the expected grid index is conclusively presumed to be accurate but may be changed in accordance with section 8(e). Final grid index: A grid index determined by FCIC based on NOAA’s interpolated gridded precipitation data or successor data, based on a 24-hour period determined by the data, for each grid ID and index interval, expressed as a percentage. The data used to calculate the final grid index is conclusively presumed to be accurate unless notified by NOAA CPC in writing that there is an issue with the data and the revised data is provided. Grid: An area identified by longitude and latitude used to determine the expected grid index, final grid index, premium and indemnity. The grid is a 0.25 degree gridded area, or successor area, established by NOAA CPC. Grid identification number (grid ID): A specific number assigned to each grid. Lease Certification Form: A self-certified form used by you to certify a lease agreement. Point of reference: The location provided by the insured of the insured acreage.

Rainfall Index Disclaimer By signing below, I certify that I understand the following. 1. The Rainfall Index plan of insurance is not a plan of insurance against a loss of actual production. The terms and conditions of the Rainfall Index are different from those of an Actual Production History plan of insurance. The Rainfall Index plan of insurance does not measure, capture, or utilize the actual crop production of any producer or any of the actual crop production within the grid, county or state. It is based upon grid indices, not individual farm yields. 2. Selecting index intervals when precipitation is not needed for the insured crop or when precipitation does not normally occur is not an effective use of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance. 3. The Rainfall Index is a risk management tool to insure against a decline in an index value that is based on the long-term historical average precipitation for the grid and index interval. It is best suited for producers whose production tends to follow and correlate to the historical average interpolated precipitation patterns for the grid. 4. It is possible for me to have low crop production or receive low precipitation amounts on the acreage I insure and still not receive an indemnity payment under this plan. 5. The only insurable cause of loss is having a final grid index less than my trigger grid index. 6. There are historical indices, information, and other tools on the RMA website to help me determine if the Rainfall Index is suitable for my risk management needs.

Overview This exhibit provides an example of a producer who has elected to insure PRF acreage under the Rainfall Index plan of insurance.

However, there are some differences between the Rainfall Index and the apiculture, AF, and PRF programs. Some of the differences include, but are not limited to, the number of index intervals required to be insured, limitations on the maximum percent of value that may be selected in an index interval, growing seasons, the applicability of different intended uses, and the payment calculation factor. See the Rainfall Index Plan Common Policy, AF CP, Apiculture CP and AD for more information about each plan and crop policy. The following information is applicable to this example. (1) The county base value per acre for an intended use of grazing is $20.00. (2) The expected grid index is 100 for each grid ID, intended use, and index interval. (3) The premium rate for 90 percent coverage level for an intended use of grazing is: (a) 0.1000 in the April ‒ May index interval; and (b) 0.1100 in the July ‒ August index interval.

Insurable Interest Insurable interest is the insured’s percentage of the insured crop that is at financial risk. When the insured crop is the PRF with an intended use of grazing, the insured’s percentage of the insured crop that is at financial risk will be based on the insured’s percentage: (1) interest in the livestock to be grazed on the insured acres, if the acres are cash leased; or (2) of the value gained of the livestock being grazed on the insured acres if the acres are share leased. Lessors under a cash lease are not considered to have a share in the insured crop. Important: For the intended use of grazing under PRF, the insurable interest in the crop is based on the interest in the livestock and not the land. If requested, records must be provided to determine if the acreage is cash leased or share leased and that the producer has grazed livestock in past will be required. If natural causes require the producer to destock their livestock, records demonstrating disposition are acceptable.

    "document": "Insurable Interest for Pasture, Rangeland, Forage with Intended Use of Grazing (Continued): E. Determining Shares An insurable share is the percentage of interest in the insured crop the owner, owner-operator, tenant has at the time insurance attaches. For the intended use of grazing for PRF, the insurable interest is based upon the percentage of interest in the livestock or percentage interest in the value gained of the livestock. When determining shares, identify if the acres are owned or leased on a cash basis; or leased for a share of the profit in the livestock. Once that determination is made, review the lease in conjunction with the FSA-578 (Report of Acreage), or Resource Land Units to identify the location of the acreage and the quantity of acreage available to the producer for insurance (the “insurable acreage”). Documentation that supports insurable acreage can be, but are not limited to: (1) Grazing permit (BLM, USFS, State); (a) For BLM acreage, shares will be determined based on the producer’s Active Use AUMs. (2) Lease Agreement; (3) Property Tax Records; and (4) Deeds. An FSA-578 is NOT acceptable documentation by itself for determining shares. FSA programs and PRF have different rules/criteria for determining who has a share in a crop, and therefore, may not be appropriate for PRF. The FSA-578 may be used in support of or in conjunction with other documentation for determining shares but cannot be used as the only documentation for determining shares. The following are examples of using the FSA-578 in conjunction with lease, grazing permit, or ownership records to determine insurable acreage; however, upon request livestock records may also need to be provided for the intended use of grazing: Example 1: Lessee K leases land from the BLM. Lessee K reports the lease to FSA and obtains an FSA-578. Lessee K provides the FSA-578 and BLM master allotment report. The FSA-578 provides the location of the land and reports the producer has 100% share of 50,000 acres. The BLM master allotment report clarifies that the producer only has access to 100 animal unit month (AUM) within the allotment along with four other producers. The total Active Use AUMs on the BLM allotment is 400. In this case the producer has 25% share in 50,000 acres rather.",

The FSA-578 provides the location of the land and reports the producer has 100% share of 10,000 acres. The BLM master allotment report indicates that the total acres within the allotment are 10,000 acres, but 2,000 of those acres are private land within the boundaries of the allotment.

Example 3: Landowner X has 200 acres of grazing land that are used for grazing cattle and are reported to FSA as grazing. Landowner X is requested to provide records of livestock ownership and the acreage. To meet the request, Landowner X provides sales records of cattle, an FSA-578, and tax records from the previous year to show ownership of the acreage.
