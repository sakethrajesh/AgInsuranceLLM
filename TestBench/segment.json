The percent of value allows insureds with more than one unit to individualize their coverage within the requirements of the program. Using the percent of value insureds can allocate a percentage of the total insured value to each selected index interval. Example: Insured A has a 100 percent share in 1000 insurable acres in the grid and elects to insure all 1000 acres with an intended use of grazing. The county base value is $20.00 per acre. Insured A selects a 90 percent coverage level, 120 percent productivity factor, and the April – May and July – August index intervals. The dollar amount of protection per acre is $21.60 ($20.00 × .90 × 1.20) and the total policy protection is $21600 ($21.60 × 1000 acres). Insured A allocates 60 percent of the total value to the April – May index interval and 40 percent to the July – August index interval. Based on Insured A’s allocation, the policy protection amount for the unit comprised of the April – May index interval is $12960 ($21.60 × 1000 acres × 60 percent of value × 1.00 share). The policy protection amount for the unit comprised of the July – August index interval is $8640 ($21.60 × 1000 acres × 40 percent of value × 1.00 share). The total policy protection amount ($21600) does not change. Regardless of how the total value is allocated between index intervals, the sum of the percentages for all index intervals, by grid ID, share, irrigated practice, organic practice (if applicable), and intended use, must equal 100 percent.There may be a minimum and maximum percent of value that can be allocated to an index interval.

Selection of index intervals is critical to the effectiveness of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance as a risk management tool. Factors to be considered when determining which index intervals to select include, but are not limited to, type of forage or plant to be pollinated, location, elevation, intended use, and the time period when precipitation is needed under normal conditions for the insured crop. Selecting index intervals when precipitation is not needed for the insured crop or when precipitation does not normally occur is not an effective use of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance nor is insuring periods when livestock or colonies will be on the property unless that corresponds to when precipitation is critical. Example: Based on the location of the land, type of grass, and intended use, precipitation is needed in the months of March, April, May, and June for the grass to produce a normal amount of forage under normal conditions during the normal growing season. Selecting index intervals before March or after June would not be an effective use of the Rainfall Index plan of insurance because precipitation received during those index intervals is not as needed for the normal growing season.",

method for locating the insured’s acreage.

enter the city and state near the acreage to be insured, or the county and state in which
the acreage to be insured is physically located, then click the “Search” button.
(2) Navigate close to where the acreage to be insured is physically located. Use of the zoom
function and alternative map views may help identify roads, ponds, buildings, rivers, or

The point of reference selected by the insured will determine the grid ID and county. The
insured must establish a point of reference for the acreage to be insured and reported on the
acreage report for API and PRF.
Establish a point of reference by positioning the curser within the boundaries of the acreage to
be insured and clicking the left mouse button. A blue or red point of reference symbol will be
displayed on the map where the point of reference is established. In addition, a popup
information balloon containing the following for the point of reference will display.
(1) Grid ID
(2) Latitude
(3) Longitude
(4) County
(5) State
The same information will display to the left of the map under “Current Location.” Use the
zoom function and different map views to identify the acreage to be insured and ensure the
point of reference is accurate and within the boundaries of acreage to be insured.
If the point of reference selected is not within the boundaries of the acreage to be insured,
remove the point of reference by clicking the “Clear All” button in the upper left-hand corner of

water) and no insurance offer is available for that partial grid ID. If an insured has
acreage in that partial grid, the insured can cover that acreage under the closest grid ID
with an insurance offer. AIP’s must keep documentation identifying the original location
grid ID. Only acres located within the United States can be insured.

    "document": "Acreage Reporting: The insured is not required to insure 100 percent of the insurable acres; however, for the acreage to be eligible for insurance coverage, the insured must select the index intervals and percent of value for the growing season in which they desire coverage by sales closing date and report any planted acres by the 5th day of the month immediately following the planting period for the growing season. Per the CP, acreage planted and not reported by the acreage reporting date for the growing season will not be insurable. Example: For coverage in Growing Season 2 the annual forage crop must be planted on or after September 1 and on or before September 30 of the same crop year. The planted acreage must be reported by October 5th. The index interval and associated values must be selected by Sales Closing Date. The available index intervals for this growing season will be from October 1 through April 30 of the same crop year. An acreage report is not required to be filed for each growing season. If no acreage was planted during the month the insured is not required to file an acreage report. However, if an acreage report is not timely filed by the acreage reporting date, there will be no coverage and the acreage will not be insurable. Failure to file a timely acreage report does not qualify for modifying an acreage report as provided in Part 2, Para. 18A.",

    "Double Cropped Acreage Involving an Annual Forage Crop: When there is a double cropping scenario involving an insured AF crop, the requirements in 6(k)(1)-(3) of the RI Basic Provisions must be met to qualify as double cropping. If those requirements are not met, then the acreage will be subject to the first and second crop rules. Example 1: Planting an annual forage crop (i.e., haygrazer) following a failed spring or summer crop (i.e., cotton) does not meet the requirement for a full indemnity on both crops in the same crop year, because it does not meet the requirements of Sections 6(k)(1) and (2). It is not customary to plant the haygrazer on the same acres of cotton that are taken to harvest in the same crop year. Example 2: Planting an annual forage crop (i.e., corn for silage) following a failed winter crop for grain (i.e., wheat) may meet the requirements for potentially receiving a full indemnity on both crops in the same crop year, because it may be possible to take the wheat to harvest and follow it with corn for silage in the same crop year, if it is customary and a practice generally recognized by agricultural experts for the area.",
