However, other products that utilize the provisions of the RI plans of insurance were approved by the FCIC Board of Directors under Section 508(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The PRF program is an RMA developed product approved by the FCIC Board of Directors under Section 522(c) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. The apiculture and the AF programs are privately developed products approved by the FCIC Board of Directors under Section 508(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. ",

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides that 'No person in the United States shall on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.' Therefore, programs and activities that receive Federal financial assistance must operate in a non-discriminatory manner. Also, a recipient of RMA funding may not retaliate against any person because they opposed an unlawful practice or policy or made charges, testified, or participated in a complaint under Title VI. It is the AIPs' responsibility to ensure that standards, procedures, methods, and instructions as authorized by FCIC in the sale and service of crop insurance contracts are implemented in a manner compliant with Title VI. Information regarding Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the program discrimination complaint process is available on the USDA public website at www.ascr.usda.gov. For more information on the RMA Non-Discrimination Statement, see the DSSH.",

Insureds may elect a productivity factor between 60 percent and 150 percent in 1 percent increments and only one productivity factor can be selected by county crop and intended use. Example: Insured A is insuring alfalfa acreage with an intended use of haying in a county with a county base value of $269.54 per acre. Insured A believes the alfalfa acreage has a greater value than the county base value and selects a productivity factor of 115, thereby increasing the dollar amount of protection per acre by 15 percent. If insured A believed the alfalfa acreage had less value than the county base value, a productivity factor less than 100 could have been selected, thereby reducing the dollar amount of protection per acre.",
